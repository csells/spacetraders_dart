# spacetraders_dart

SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of
HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.
This is a Dart client created for SpaceTraders using [the SpaceTraders OpenAPI
definition](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs/blob/main/reference/SpaceTraders.json)
and [the OpenAPI generator
tool](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

[The SpaceTraders API is documented
online](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs). You can [send your first
request right here in your browser](https://api.spacetraders.io/v2) to check the
status of the game server.

Unlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or
app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client
(which is where this project comes from), write a script to automate your ships,
or try an app built by the community.

SpaceTraders has a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5)
where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other
players.
